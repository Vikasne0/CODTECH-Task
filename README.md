TASK -- 1-

**Overview of the Password Strength Checker Code**
This Python script helps users assess the strength of their passwords by scoring them based on:

Length: Points for having at least 8, 12, and 16 characters.
Complexity: Checks for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, adding points for each type present.
Uniqueness: Compares the password against a list of common passwords and advises users if theirs is too common.
Strength Evaluation: Classifies the password as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on the total score.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Checks: Include checks for sequences and repeated characters.

User Feedback: Provide specific suggestions for improving weak passwords.

Password History: Prevent reuse of previous passwords.

Integration: Adapt for use in web applications or password managers.

Localization: Support multiple languages for broader accessibility.

Data Security: Use updated databases of compromised passwords.

User Interface: Create a graphical user interface for easier interaction.

Conclusion
This password strength checker is a useful tool for creating secure passwords, with opportunities for enhancements
to improve its effectiveness and user experience
